*Your Smart Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Assistant*


*Feature 1 Preprocess*

Preprocess is an intelligent web-based tool designed to automate and simplify the preprocessing of datasets for machine learning projects. Built using **Python (Flask)**, **Bootstrap**, and **pandas**, it helps users upload datasets (CSV/Excel), automatically detect data issues, and perform cleaning steps like handling missing values, encoding, scaling, and more — all with just a few clicks.

*Feature 2 EDA*

A comprehensive machine learning visualizer and educational platform. As a learner, I found myself constantly scrolling through different sites for data analysis tools. SmartAnalysis consolidates everything in one place, saving time and making it easier for you to visualize, learn, and experiment with machine learning algorithms.
